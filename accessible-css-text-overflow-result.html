<td colspan="1">All text is read, even that which is not visually visible. The ellipsis character is not read; the text is read out as if there were no ellipsis there. In the "clip" example, as Narrator reads the text that lies outside the visual container, it scrolls the text so that the text being read scrolls into view. But it does NOT do that for the "ellipsis" example.</td>
